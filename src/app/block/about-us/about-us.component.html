            <h3>History of the Temple</h3>
            <p>The founders of Om Sri Sai Balaji Temple envisioned creating a place of worship for individuals largely based in
              the Tri-State area. After several years of research, planning, and perseverance, the founders were fortunate enough
              to secure land for the temple in Monroe, New Jersey. All plans and architectural designs were presented to the
              Planning Board of Monroe Township. The township unanimously approved the plan to construct the Authentic Hindu
              Temple and Cultural Center. An auspicious groundbreaking ceremony for the Om Sri Sai Balaji Temple was performed
              on June 26, 2016. Let us join together to create a beautiful place of worship for Lord Venkateswara and many more
              deities, including a 22 feet Hanuman idol.</p>
